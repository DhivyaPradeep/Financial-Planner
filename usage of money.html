        <p>Expense tracking is a useful exercise at the national level as well, because it gives government agencies and policymakers insight on consumer spending and whether current programs or policies are having positive or negative effects. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) serve this purpose for the Federal Government by issuing consumer-spending updates.To get a broad scale picture of expenditures without seasonal factors or one-off annual expenses, it is best to compare annual consumer expenditures.The recently released BLS Consumer Expenditures report for 2015 offers a mix of good news and points of concern. In general, Americans are spending more per "consumer unit", defined as a group with shared expenses â€” a family, singles living alone (or sharing but financially independent of each other), or two or more people in a household that share expenses.</p>
